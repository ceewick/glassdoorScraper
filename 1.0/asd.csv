It took me about 2 weeks from the time the recruiter first contacted me to the time I got the offer. The recruiters were really prompt on following up on all the minor details, very adjustable to scheduling and quick to respond on interview results. The overall interview experience itself was unique where I had my lunch interviewer take me for a walk by the beach after having lunch with the entire team. The interviews were very similar to what you expect at any top tech company but I really liked the fact that I was allowed to code in an IDE of my choice instead of writing on white board.- On-boarding process: The new hire on-boarding process is brief and to the point. It was a sweet surprise to see that people already know you by name when you are taken for walk around the campus buildings.- Engineering team: The engineering team is well organized and well structured. Its a great opportunity to do full stack development where you are allowed to work on features end to end. There is a strong sense of ownership and commitment to deliver features. Every team has a good mix of junior and senior developers. Since it is such a small team and the product is growing continuously, there are plenty of opportunities to showcase your potential and grow.- Work: Because of the unique and ephemeral nature of the product, the work is really challenging and interesting. It's good to have your entire day focussed on solving the problem as I spend less than 30 minutes a day on emails and meetings. It also allows me to get work done quickly and leave early.- Office space: Although, I was initially skeptical about working in an office space right by the beach, I have started to really like it now. Its literally a beach house transferred to office space and it has all the amenities with an amazing view from the roof top and the deck. Whenever I see myself getting stuck in a problem, I tend to go for a walk by the beach to the shore and refresh myself. Sometimes, we just go out and relax ourselves with a game of volley ball. The office staff are really kind and there is security people in and around the building 24X7.- Food: It's really great that I can turn up at work and not worry about cooking lunch or dinner as food is prepared by the chef daily and the entire team has lunch together. If you want to eat outside, there is also an option to eat at a few handpicked restaurants just by showing your badge.- Transparency: Every engineering team meets with the leadership team on weekly basis where we are told about all the different things happening within the company - new features, growth, monetization strategy, etc. It is quite amazing to see the level of business details shared with the engineering team.- Compensation: The base pay is comparable to any other top tech companies and no other tech company can match the equity portion provided here.",- Staying at Venice can be a little expensive- Continued growth means that the cafeteria is getting crowded during lunch and dinner. It might be worth considering having another one.- Easier to get distracted by events happening at the beach.,Keep up the good work and ensure that the culture of snapchat remains intact as we continue to grow.,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Snap-Reviews-E671946.htm/Reviews/Employee-Review-Snap-RVW6362972.htm

However, Snapchat is a place that turned out to be as, if not a little more serious, than most of them. The people here are extremely driven and motivated.I think what drives a lot of Snapchat's views, beliefs, and policies, is the fact that it has not let its ideologies be motivated or influenced by external stimuli. Most of the decisions taken here are very objective and independent, and unlike a lot of what I saw at various Bay Area firms. A lot of this originates from the upper level management.My favorite thing about working here is being in the middle of such a rapid and crucial growth phase. Being an active part of such growth is a very educational process, and it is really motivating to see people going above and beyond to push the company forward.

Unlike every other tech company, working from home is frowned upon.
